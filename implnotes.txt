Implementation Notes
====================

Caveats:
      cf. file "abinotes.txt" included with this source code.

Further Notes:

- I decided to use ENTER for clarity instead of the regular

        PUSH    RBP
        MOV     RBP, RSP

  as function prologue, despite the size/speed tradeoff.

- compilation of individual files:
    for NASM; assemble with nasm -f elf64 -o hello.o hello.asm

- to use C library linkage, link with gcc -o program <module-list>
